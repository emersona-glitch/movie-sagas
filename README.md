I NEED TO ASK ABOUT:




TODO:


fetch saga for database
map database to reducer
    serverside stuff




HOME PAGE --> DETAILS PAGE
|
v
ADD PAGE



FOR ME TO DO:

make the readme nice
get all of your dependencies
make a database
make a junction table
    remember how they even work (which assignment) -- got it
    
sagas are partially set up

home page should display all movies in movie database

clicking on a poster image should take you to the /details view

details page should show all details including genres for the movie
(do a get request for a specific movie)
back to list button 

add movie page.
cancel button 
dropdown
Hint: Look at the /api/movie POST route -- it's been made already
Hint: You'll want to use the genres that are in the db for your dropdown
just one genre for base

28hrs to code
how to even split up these hours.
10 min break every 20 minutes or some shit

18-hrs to think about how you're going to code this thing
54 * 20' minute chunks. Commit each time

great job bro.

still pretty good even if you roll over...I mean yeah I sure as fuck hope
you're spending at least a third of the time to yourself!
